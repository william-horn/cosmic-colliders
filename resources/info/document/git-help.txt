--- INITIAL SETUP 

1. Go to the project folder
2. Open terminal with the directory set to the project folder
3. Type 'git init' to initialize the project folder as a local repository
4. Type 'git clone <github ssh key>'
5. IMMEDIATELY create a develop branch by typing 'git checkout -b develop'
6. IMMEDIATELY pull the develop branch from github into your local develop branch by typing 'git pull origin develop'

You should now be in sync with our main shared branch.

--- GETTING STARTED

1. If you know what you're going to work on, first MAKE SURE you're in the local develop branch.
2. BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING, make sure to PULL from the remote develop branch to make sure you have the most updated version.

    NOTE: do this by typing 'git pull origin develop'

3. THEN do 'git checkout -b feature/<your branch name>' to branch off of the updated develop branch 
4. IMMEDIATELY do 'git push -u origin feature/<your branch name>' to update the repo with the new branch you made.

    NOTE:   after this step you will only need to type 'git push' for every push you make going forward. This is because
            of the '-u' in the 'git push -u origin feature/<your branch name>' command. VERY useful.

5. Begin working. Make sure to 'git add', 'git commit', and 'git push' whenever you make a big change.

That's all.
We will do git merging as a team for now, so don't worry about merging branches unless you know what you're doing.
