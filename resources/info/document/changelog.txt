| ABOUT CHANGE LOG |
==================================================================================================================================

-- What Is This? --

This change log system was developed to help keep track of changes made to a program file for independent or collaborative work. 
The goal was to reduce comment clutter in a program file while still keeping a descriptive log of changes made TO that program 
file stored away in a different file. There are no new technologies associated with this system, it is simply an organizational 
tool using folders, txt files with information, and your text editor's search function.

*   This specific system was developed with VSCode's search feature (and others like it) in mind.

*   The intention of this system is not to replace commenting your code, but just to store and link verbose comments within
    a different file.


-- How Do I Use This? --

Recording a change made to a document (using this system) is done by creating a "change record". A change record is a plain-text
entry within the local changelog file. Each directory containing a program file that wishes to keep a changelog will have a 
folder called "changelog" inside of it. Inside this folder are text files that are named after the program file it is tracking. 
So, if a program file is named "index.html", then its changelog file will be named "index.html.txt" which is inside 
of the changelog folder. The hierarchy will look something like this:


    <Program File Directory>
        |
        |__program-file.html 
        |
        |__changelog
            |
            |__program-file.html.txt


There will only be one changelog folder per directory. Tracking another program file does not require creating another changelog 
folder.

Once the files are established you can start making change records. As mentioned before, change records are just text entries
to the changelog files. However, they follow a specific format. They are instantiated by writing:


    @changelog-record:log[id.version]
        -   some description about the change here


Here is the above example broken down:


    '@changelog-record:log'         - an anchor tag that let's us know we're creating a new change record in the changelog txt file
    'id.version'                    - the numeric id of the change followed by it's version (a sub-change, or modification to a change)


Here is an example of how some change records might look within the context of a project. This is what the content inside the 
changelog files will look like:

======================
| CHANGE LOG RECORDS |
==================================================================================================================================

    ============================
    | @changelog-version:0.0.0 |
    ============================

        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                                     | @changelog-date:xx/xx/xxxx |
                                                                                                     ------------------------------
        @changelog-record:log[1.0]
            -   changed header of website from X to Y 
            -   updated color scheme

            @changelog-record:log[1.1]
                -   reverted to old color scheme


        @changelog-record:log[2.0]
            -   changed footer of website from X to Y

        *OTHER:
            - general change #1
            - general change #2

        *TODO:
            - do this
            - and that

        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Sort by Version [Added: 02/26/2022] --

Changelog records are now ALSO sorted by version number of the linked program file. For example, if your program file has 
updated through versions 1.0.0, 1.0.1, and 1.0.2, the changes made to the program during these versions should be recorded 
within the changelog file along with the name of the version number they occurred during. Search for '@changelog-version' to 
list all of the version numbers of your program file along with their respective file edits. 


-- Sort by Date --

All of these change records WITHIN a version category are grouped and sorted by date. The date is displayed at the far right 
of the delimiter lines.

Notice that the date is prefixed with the anchor tag '@changelog-date:`, this means you can also search for groups of change
records by date. You will also notice there is an 'OTHER:' and 'TODO:' list below the change records. These lists are optional 
and should not be visible by default. They exist to write down changes you made that aren't worth creating a change record for.
Think of "OTHER" and "TODO" as sticky notes.


-- Nesting Change Records -- 

If you record a change and later make minor adjustments to that change, you can nest changelog records within each other by 
indenting and writing the new record. This new record's id should stay the same, whereas the second number (the version number)
should be incremented by one. For example, '@changelog-record:log[1.1]` is written below `@changelog-record:log[1.0]` and is 
indented.


-- Using Change Records in Your Program File --

All of the information above is just for creating a change record directly in the changelog folder, completely hidden away from 
the main program file. However, you may also write these change record comments within your program file if the change you made 
affects a block of code that you want to track. This is optional, but encouraged when refactoring your own code or working with
other developers.

You can do this by enclosing a block of code within the '@changelog-record:start[id.version]` and 
'@changelog-record:end[id.version]' anchor tags as a comment. For example:


    ----
    CODE IN PROGRAM FILE: 
    ----

    var x = 0

    /* @changelog-record:start[1.0] */          <----
    while (x < 10) {
        x+=2;
    }
    /* @changelog-record:end[1.0] */            <----

    ----


Not every change in a program file warrants documenting a change record, but there are a few benefits to doing so:


    1.  Searching for change records with your text editor's search function will now also show you where in the program 
        file the change was made, in addition to locating the information about the change in the changelog file.
    
    2.  While you're in your program file you will be able to see what code you changed without needing to switch
        immediately to your changelog file.


That's all for now!
